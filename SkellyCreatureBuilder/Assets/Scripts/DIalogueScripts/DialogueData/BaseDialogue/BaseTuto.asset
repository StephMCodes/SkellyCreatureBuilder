  - The Depths, where I've established my base.
  - On the left you see the dark forest where the witch covenant likes to congregate,
    attempting to create creatures of their own. They think they can imitate me.
  - On the right is the Junkyard where the bones discarded by the Order fall. Scraps,
    the Garbage Collector spirit, calls that place home.
  - 'At the heart of it all is where I''m building the Necrospire to reach the Order
    once more. But I''m lacking supplies: bones. Scraps said he could help.'
  - To face the witches, I put my creatures together and weave a facsimile of life
    within them. They never last long, condemning me to eternally make new ones,
    but they serve their purpose.
  - Let's check in with Scraps, my supply guy. I know for a fact he wants me to defeat
    some witches.
