  dialogue:
  - The Gods swim in it to create universes, creatures out of parts assembled in
    increasingly unique ways.
  - Each one of their departed souls creating a star in the void, but the darkness
    always expands.
  - With time, they grew more and more bored, petulant and irritable. But there was
    always an Order to things.
  - The universes were the playthings with which the gods could sow the chaos found
    in their hearts as opposed to against each other.
