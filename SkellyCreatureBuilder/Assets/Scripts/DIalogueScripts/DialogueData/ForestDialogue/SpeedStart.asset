  dialogue:
  - In this part of the woods is a ghastly witch approaching me. In front of her
    lies some sort of speed test.
  - '"Let''s find out who has the fastest skelly: it''ll only take 20 seconds! Aw,
    you sure you can do it?"'
  - The witch seems to pity me. Clearly she thinks im some sort of underdog.
  - To enpower my chimera to win the race, I must mash the space button as much as
    possible.
