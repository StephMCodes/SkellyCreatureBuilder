  dialogue:
  - I've finally made it. The Order stares me down.
  - "\u201CYou\u2019ve really made quite the ruckus down there."
  - "\rWe never expected such creativity from you. It's something to think about.
    Still, you wouldn't have been able to make anything without our scraps, of course.\r"
  - "\rNo matter. The Order could use your talents. We quite like your ideas, but
    ideas in the wrong hands can create\u2026 unnecessary chaos."
  - "\rWord is that even lower spirits have started to create chimeras now. Unacceptable:
    they're not like us. We will put an end to that together.\r"
  - "\rCreation belongs in the hands of the worthy. That is the law.\r\nYou may return
    to us, where you belong. As long as you stay in line, as we\u2019re sure you
    understand.\r"
  - "You have been far away from us for too long: have you learned your lesson? Are
    you ready to weave heavens with us again, as our fellow? Have you had your fun?\u201D\r\n\r"
