  - "\u201CYou\u2019ve really made quite the ruckus down there.\u201D\r"
  - "\r\u201CWe never expected such creativity from you. It's something to think
    about. Still, you wouldn't have been able to make anything without our scraps,
    of course.\u201D\r"
  - "\r\u201CNo matter. The Order could use your talents. We quite like your ideas,
    but ideas in the wrong hands can create\u2026 unnecessary chaos.\u201D"
  - "\r\u201CWord is that even lower spirits have started to create chimeras now.
    Unacceptable: they're not like us. We will put an end to that together.\u201D\r"
  - "\r\u201CCreation belongs in the hands of the worthy. That is the law.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou
    may return to us, where you belong. As long as you stay in line, as we\u2019re
    sure you understand.\u201D\r"
  - "\r\u201CYou have been far away from us for too long: have you learned your lesson?
    Are you ready to weave heavens with us again, as our fellow? Have you had your
    fun?\u201D\r\n\r"
