  dialogue:
  - Hey pal, glad to see you here. You can always get your trash freebies from me!
    I respect authority, unlike some other souls. Authority feeds me bones!
  - Listen. Those witches are getting in the way of my business. They come at night,
    cackling and stealing from my pile to make their own undead goons!
  - "It\u2019s getting on my nerves! Can't they just support a local business like
    normal people?"
  - I don't mind sharing bones, but I want something in return. You want to build
    up your tower right?
  - Say what - i'll help you build a floor every time you show the forest covenant
    what's what. That's a promise!
